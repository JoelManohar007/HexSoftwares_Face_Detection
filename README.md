# Face Detection Using OpenCV — HexSoftwares Internship Project
## Overview
This project implements real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. The application accesses the webcam feed, detects faces in the video stream using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, and highlights them with bounding boxes.

## Features
Real-time face detection from webcam input.

Uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier for accurate and fast detection.

Displays detected faces with blue rectangles on screen.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV Python package (install via pip install opencv-python)

## How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Open terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

## Run the Python script:

bash
python face_detection.py
A window will open showing webcam video with detected faces bounded by rectangles.

Press 'q' to exit the video and close the window.
